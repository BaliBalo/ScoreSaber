			<div class="question">How often is the list of ranked songs updated?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				The ranked songs list is gathered using the APIs from ScoreSaber and BeatSaver and is updated frequently. New ranked songs should appear within 15 minutes, while unranks can take up to a few hours to be updated.<br><br>
				The last update was <span id="last-update">???</span>
			</div>
			<div class="question">What are the sorting options?</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<div class="sort-name">Score est.</div>
				<div class="sort-desc">
					The algorithm looks at your current scores and tries to figure out what score (percentage) you would get for each difficulty level. Recent scores affect the curve more than older ones.<br>
					<div class="curve-wrapper">
						<button id="export-curve">export</button>
						<canvas id="score-est-curve"></canvas>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sort-name">Score at rank</div>
				<div class="sort-desc">
					For each song, the score of the person ranked on this song at your global rank (or the rank specified) is used if better than your current score (works mostly for high-ranked players).
				</div>
				<div class="sort-name">Fixed score</div>
				<div class="sort-desc">
					Uses a specified fixed score percentage value as the potential score (by default 94.33%, which equates to the raw amount of PP for a map).
				</div>
				<div class="sort-name">Compare</div>
				<div class="sort-desc">
					Use the scores of another given user. If the other player has a better score than you on a map, their score will be used as the potential score.
				</div>
				<div class="sort-name">Worst/Best Rank</div>
				<div class="sort-desc">
					Sort songs by your rank on them, without taking into account the potential PP gain.
				</div>
				<div class="sort-name">Worst Score</div>
				<div class="sort-desc">
					Put maps on which you have the lowest score (as a percentage) at the top.
				</div>
				<div class="sort-name">Oldest Score</div>
				<div class="sort-desc">
					Put maps you've done the longest ago at the top.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question">Things are inaccurate</div>
			<div class="answer">Due to ScoreSaber rounding some values and keeping some information private, the results of this tool are not 100% accurate. It's as close as possible though.</div>
